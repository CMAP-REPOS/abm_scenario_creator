CMAP-REPOS / tmm_programs
=======================
As a part of the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP)](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov)'s [Advanced Urban Model Development](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/transportation/modeling) effort, a "Transit Modernization Model" has been developed that will allow for the incorporation of detailed information about the Chicago region's transit systems into our Travel Demand Models. This information includes rail station/bus stop cleanliness, the ease of boarding a particular vehicle, seating comfort, and the presence of real-time information at a station/stop, among other things.

To allow CMAP's policy staff to estimate the effects of implementing a number of changes to the transit system (e.g. adding Wi-Fi to all Metra trains), the tools in this repository were developed to provide them with a GIS-based method of specifying those changes, and subsequently applying them to the [Emme](http://www.inrosoftware.com/en/products/emme/) network(s) used for Travel Demand Modeling.
